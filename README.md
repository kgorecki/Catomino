# Catomino

It's my first approach to Godot engine.

## Game description

It's turn-based, domino-alike game in which players are rescuing cats from the boxes. Each player draws a domino card (with images instead of dots). Then (s)he has to place it somewhere on the map adjacent to any other card. If the same images are next to eachother, player draws a closed box, which (s)he puts on the connecting line of the 2 cards. Then the box opens to see if the're is a cat inside. The player who rescued the most of the cats wins.
